should the x3dh trigger when alice sends the first message or when she attempts to start a conversation?
	if so what would bob use for the DH public key if he wants to respond? since Alice sends over the x3dh info not double ratchet info

is our DH function correct? when calculating in x3dh

is KDF function correct?

what is the point of the associated data?

are we supposed to have nonce / salt?

what are we supposed to do with the private keys?

is approach to generating ratchet keys correct?
